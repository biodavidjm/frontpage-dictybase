            <ol>
                <li>Give fresh <a ng-href="#/research/techniques/media/media.html#HL-5">HL5</a> medium to all plates to be resuspended.
                </li>

                <li>Resuspend wildtype cells from 2 or 3 plates and transfer to a sterile 50&nbsp;ml conical tube.
                </li>

                <li>Pellet cells by spinning in tabletop centrifuge at 2,000&nbsp;rpm for 5&nbsp;minutes.
                </li>

                <li>Draw off HL5 medium and replace with COLD H50 buffer. Be sure to not disturb the cell pellet. Resuspend cells to wash and pellet as before.
                </li>

                <li>Draw off 1st H50 wash and replace with a 2nd 10ml aliquot. Resuspend cells to wash again and remove a small aliquot using a Pasteur pipette and bulb. Add a drop of resuspension to each side of grid on hemacytometer. Gently place cover glass over grid.
                </li>

                <li>Note remaining volume of resuspension and pellet as before.
                </li>

                <li>Count cells on grid and determine the total number of cells in tube.
                </li>

                <li>Draw off 2nd H50 wash and replace with an appropriate volume of H50 such that the final cell density is 5 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml.
                </li>

                <li>Thaw DAPI in DMSO stock solution. Dilute DAPI in 100&nbsp;µl cell/H50 suspension such that final DAPI concentration is 1.5&nbsp;µg/ml. Cell suspension and DAPI are mixed in a 0.5&nbsp;ml microfuge tube. Use DAPI stock solution at a concentration such that the amount of DMSO added to reaction is minimized (use highest concentration of DAPI stock solution possible).
                </li>

                <li>Place cells/DAPI in a pre-chilled 0.1&nbsp;mm cuvette; leave cuvette on ice for 3&nbsp;minutes.
                </li>

                <li>Place cuvette in cold cuvette holder<!--(kept in the door of -20&deg;C freezer)-->. Zap (pulse or electroporate) cells @ 0.85&nbsp;kV and 25&nbsp;µF by depressing two red buttons simultaneously until a beep is heard. Record time constants.
                </li>

                <li>Immediately following electroporation, add 1&nbsp;ml of HL5 medium to cuvette. Leave cuvette at room temperature for 10&nbsp;minutes.
                </li>

                <li>Use gel loading pipette tip to remove ~200&nbsp;µl aliquots from cuvette (don't forget to remove cells between electrodes) and add to a coated coverslip.
                </li>

                <li>Allow cells to settle onto coverslip for 1hr before adding an additional 1&nbsp;ml HL5 medium to well. Add medium to edge of well such that cells attached to coverslip are not disturbed. Allow cells to recover for additional 3&nbsp;hrs.
                </li>

                <li>Observe cells on an inverted scope using oil immersion lens and DAPI filter. Neutral density filters may be needed to&nbsp;minimize glare caused by intense staining.
                </li>
            </ol>
