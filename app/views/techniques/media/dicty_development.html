                    It is important to harvest cells in mid-log phase for development (1-4 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>-1</sup>). This will favor synchronous development. At high cell density, many of the cells in a culture will have initiated development, thus yielding inconsistent results.<br>
                    Try to maintain sterility throughout this process. Since development is induced by starvation, and Dictyostelium cells feed on bacteria, contamination of the buffer with bacteria or leftover medium interferes with development.<br>
                    Gene expression in Dictyostelium cells changes as soon as nutrients are removed (1,2). Therefore, to analyze vegetative cells, it is important to use the cells immediately after the three washes as described in the 'Preparation of cells for development' section. It is also important to use cold buffer to rapidly inhibit all metabolic processes, including changes in gene expression and protein synthesis and degradation. Refer to the life cycle (left) for the timing of specific developmental stages. For example, expect to see aggregation after approximately 4-6 h, and fingers or <a href="" ng-click="scrollTo('slug')">slugs</a> after approximately 16 h.<br>
                    <small><b>The <i>D. discoideum</i> life cycle.</b> Developmental morphogenesis starting from single, vegetative amoebae to the formation of the mature fruiting body, which contains a sorus of spores on top of a stalk. Aggregation is mediated by the chemotaxis of cells toward cAMP to form a multicellular aggregate. During this process, cells can be seen streaming toward a central domain or aggregation center. Aggregation results in the formation of a multicellular organism, a mound, which then forms a tipped mound. As development proceeds, the tip extends and forms a finger. The extended finger might fall over to form a phototactic migrating slug. Eventually, the finger or slug contracts and the anterior tip begins to rise to form a fruiting body. During culmination, the cells differentiate into vacuolated stalk cells that support a spore head containing spore cells. The spores tolerate a wider range of environmental conditions than the amoebae and germinate following dispersal, renewing the cycle. The entire process from starvation of vegetative cells to the formation of a mature fruiting body takes 24 h.</small>

            Inducing development of Dictyostelium
        </h3>
        <p>
            Dictyostelium cells can be developed on solid media; they are plated on filter paper for best synchronicity and if developmental stages need to be harvested for further procedures, such as protein or RNA preparations. Cells can also be developed on KK2 plates for examination of morphology or to allow agar blocks to be cut out and reoriented for better visualization. Alternatively, cells may be developed in suspension, for example, to prepare aggregation-competent cells for cell migration studies; under these conditions, cells will only progress through the first 6-8 h of development. Addition of cAMP pulses to the starved suspension culture will allow development to progress up to the 12-h stage. Lastly there is the option for developmental conditions that favor slug formation and phototaxis.

            </li>

            </li>
            <li>Start cAMP pulsing 60-120 min after the initiation of starvation. cAMP pulses are added using a timer to control a peristaltic pump that delivers cAMP to the cell suspension through tubing, which goes into the flask.

            Slug formation and phototaxis
        </h3>
        <p>
            During mid-development, Dictyostelium discoideum can choose between two different pathways. The finger stage can either proceed directly to culmination, or it can fall over to form a migratory, phototactic slug. This migratory stage is thought to enable Dictyostelium to find an appropriate site for fruiting body formation (4). Slugs form preferably in low ionic strength and in the dark, approximately 16 h after onset of starvation (5). Note that non-axenic strains such as NC-4 formslugs more efficiently than axenic strains. Here, we describe a simple way to prepare and plate cells to form phototactic slugs.

        <ol>
            <li>Grow cells <a ng-href="#/research/techniques/media/dicty_growth.html#liveSMP">on bacteria on an SM plate</a>. After cells consume the bacteria (2-3 days), wash cells off by pipetting 2 ml <a href="/techniques/media/media.html#DB">DB</a> on the plate and scraping cells off with a glass spreader. Decant cells into a 50 ml conical plastic tube and repeat this step to wash off all the cells.

            </li>
            <li>Pellet the cells one more time and resuspend in 2 ml DB. From one bacterial plate, you can expect approximately 1 x 10<sup>9</sup> cells; count cells after the last wash, as the yield will be significantly lower if cells are washed off too early, that is, before they cleared the bacterial lawn. Adjust the volume if necessary.
