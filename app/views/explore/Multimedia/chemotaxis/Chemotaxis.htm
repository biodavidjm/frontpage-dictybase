                    Confocal image of GFP-tagged chemoattractant receptors in living amoebae undergoing chemotaxis. The chemoattractant gradient is established using a micropipet located just below the frame. Images were captured every 15 seconds. From Z. Xiao and P.N.

Frames were taken every 2 seconds. The chemoattractant was added just before the cell goes out of focus. From C.A. Parent and P.N. Devreotes,&nbsp; Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.

                    Confocal image of GFP-tagged CRAC in living amoebae undergoing chemotaxis. CRAC-GFP specifically translocates to the leading edge of newly elicited pseudopods. The chemoattractant gradient is established using a micropipet located near the upper right corner of the frame. Images were captured every 5 seconds. From C.A. Parent and P.N.

                    Immobilized CRAC-GFP expressing cells can respond to changes in chemoattractant gradients. Latrunculin A treated cells were subjected to changing gradients of chemoattractants by moving the micropipet around the cell. Images were captured every 5 seconds. From C.A. Parent and P.N.
