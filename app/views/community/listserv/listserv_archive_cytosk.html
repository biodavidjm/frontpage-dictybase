                <li>Try dialysis against very low ionic strength buffer, pH 8.0 or higher, that contains a divalent cation chelator, e.g., 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.9 - 8.0. This treatment works well at removing actin from isolated plasma membranes, presumably because actin is denatured by chelation of the divalent cations, especially magnesium ions, that are required for polymerization and stabilization of the native structure [<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3818">Luna et al. 1981</a>]. Also see <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=9003">Annamma Spudich's chapter in Methods in Cell Biology (1987)</a>. She recommends 10 mM triethanolamine, pH 8.0, 0.5 mM ATP, 0.5 mM DTT, and 20&nbsp;ÂµM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. If proteolysis is a problem, you can add protease inhibitors, but increasing ionic strength will inhibit actin depolymerization.<br>

For fixation, you can use either cold methanol or formaldehyde solution, but not acetone which disrupts the microtubule array. Good luck!<br>

                <li>We have tested many different fixation methods, but we discarded formaldehyde solutions because MTs are not preserved at the EM level and other fixes such as alcohol or acetone probably have similar effects. We have, however, obtained excellent preservaiton of the MT cytoskeleton in 5 species of slime molds with a combination of fixation and permeabilization in an MT-stabilizing buffer (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=9015">Roos 1987</a>, <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=2359">Guhl and Roos 1994</a>). The monoclonal antibodies we have mostly used are the two alpha-tubulin-specific mABs TAT1 raised against Trypanosoma ctytoskeletons by Sherwood and Gull, and the yeast tubulin-specific YL/2 from John Kilmartin. I seem to remember that the latter is available commercially, but I would have to check my source. Best regards and lots of success!<br>

                <li>Disrupting the MTs in Dicty is not trivial. The MTs are cold resistant, so cold will not work. You can use nocodazole, but it takes quite a while, several hours, to really get rid of most MTs. You can wash out nocodazole. The problem is that this is not a rapid process, especially the blocking. I'd be interested to learn if anyone else has a better approach.<br>

On bacterial plates I was using 2&nbsp;Âµg/ml thiabendazole or 20&nbsp;Âµg/ml benlate, both of which allowed cells to grow and develop normally if a little slower than usual. You could try higher concentrations for a shorter period or time as I have no idea how much damage to microtubules is actually being done.<br>

In developing cells we got several bands, the most prominent being at 36 kDa. We did trypsin digests, HPLC of peptides, and aa sequencing, and the 50 kDa band was elongation factor 1-alpha, and the 36 kDa band was a close but not exact match to discoidin I (which is normally 26 kDa). I also tried immunofluorescence with anti-vimentin, anti-skelemin and anti-desmin antibodies, and saw nothing.
