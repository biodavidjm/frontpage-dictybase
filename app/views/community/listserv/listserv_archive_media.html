We observe an unusual cloudy precipitate in our HL5 medium. The precipitate slightly sediments and seems to increase over time. Our cells grow very slowly in this medium, either by lack of a nutrient (which precipitates) or because the precipitate is somehow toxic to the cells. We first suspected the new batch of peptone and thus exchanged it for another one, but the problem persists. Did anyone encountered the same problem? Any remedy or suggestions? Hopefully yours,</b><br>

So we replaced it with new bottles and problem was solved. If I remember correct its batch number was 411.... Hope you will solve the problem<br>

            <a name="media2" id="media2"></a> <b>How many of you out there use Formedium HL5? Are you happy? A few months ago, we switched from home made HL5c (Christophe Reymondís original recipe) to a commercial HL5 from the company Formedium. All the preliminary tests were fine (health, growth rate etc...) but we then realised that the medium is contaminated with particulate material, a fine&nbsp;micron-size precipitate that looks a little bit like dead bacteria. We checked, it does not grow, nothing is alive. To add to the confusion, our own medium appeared suddenly to have the same problem, even though we have checked with Formedium that we use no common source of products for the preparation!!! Formedium sent us a new batch which still has the same problem. As we perform loads of phagocytosis experiments, not knowing the impact of this particulate stuff, as a matter of prudence, we started sterile-filtering the medium which is economically not viable!! Should we care about that particulate stuff? Any idea or suggestion welcome!</b><br>

        <ul>
            <li>I have now compiled the answers about the particulate material in HL5 from Formedium, and I attach them all. The most interesting ones are the one from Steve Alexander, because it phenocopies our observations, and the one from Hirosaki Ochiai, because it likely identifies the culprit. We have now tested and decided to buy the new HL5c from Formedium, as we are happy, both because the Dictys grow well, but also because there are significantly less particles (event though not zero).<br>

            <li>We have long had masses of particulate stuff using Oxoid ingredients, though the amount varies depending on the batch of medium and how far you are through the pot of peptone. For growth of AX3, it doesn't in my experience matter if you filter-sterilize the medium. It was a rumour in Rob Kay's lab that the bits were helpful for other strains though. I don't remember either which strains or how good the evidence was.<br>

            <li>We have sometimes seen very small particles in our home made HL5 (never used Formedium). We now routinely filter our solutions on paper filters after dissolution, and before autoclaving, and that essentially gets rid of the problem for us.<br>

            <li>Markus and we have checked a commercial HL5 medium but I do not remember the company. We found somewhat slower growth compared to our home-made soup and therefore did not buy it. Concerning the particles: a long time ago we had bought FM Medium (powder) from Difco (?) and that actually turned turbid a while after you set had it up. The particles were not alife but Dicty loved them - they did not grow when you filtered them out. We had the impression back then that particles were rather good for the cells so they had something to chew on. As long as they grow for you and the particles do not interfere with your phago-assays I would not worry too much!<br>

            <li>About 2 months ago we started seeing abundant particles in our HL-5 medium as well. We make it ourselves using Bacto Proteose Peptone (now from BD). We test lots of this and then buy several bottles from the same lot. We were in the middle of a batch of several bottles when this occurred. None of the other ingredients was changed from what we had been using. The particles are about 1-2&nbsp;microns and they are not completely uniform. They do not grow on any medium at either 22 or 37 degrees. They are removable by filtering with a 0.22&nbsp;micron filter. The particles do not seem to alter growth rate or stationary phase levels at all. We first noticed the particles when we began to use 24 and 96 well plastic plates for selecting mutants resistant to drugs. However, in our first several experiments using these plates no one remembers seeing the particles. They are not as noticeable when cells are counted in a hemacytometer. We have shortened the time of autoclaving and that did not seem to help. We have used exactly the same recipe for HL5 for the past 34 years and have never seen this before. It is interesting that this is happening on both sides of the Atlantic.<br>

            <li>We are not using any readymade medium but brewing it at home. Earlier, we also faced the same kind of problem and fear. But then realised that it was a harmless thing which came up when the culture was grown to high density. Strongly suspected that it might be some salt like calcium that precipitates out. Till now any of our experiments have not shown any change in parameter due to the prescnce of these white precipitates. hope it is the same for you<br>

            <li>I see Formedium (<a target="new" href="http://www.formedium.com">www.formedium.com</a>) are now selling a full range of Dicty media. In particular they sell AX medium, HL5, HL5-C, FM and SIH. The last two are synthetic, while the first three are different proportions of peptones, yeast extract and sugar. This makes me ask - has anyone done a side-by-side comparison of these different formulations? Erwin Flaschel's lab have done so for FM and SIH. Presumably the others must have different advantages (for people to bother developing them) or suit different cell types. To kick off, two observations:
                <ol>
                    <li>SIH works excellently for Ura selection;

                    <li>Formedium's FM works fine, better than the other sources we've bought it from and somewhat better than when we make it ourselves.

            <li>I saw recently your E-mail of 02 Feb 2005. You worry about influence to cells of that particulate stuff in HL5 I think that the particulate stuff are yeast cell walls. I saw them under a microscope after separately dissolving each component of medium HL5 and I found that the particulate stuff are derived from the yeast extract, and cell wall structure could not be destroyed by autoclaving. of course the wall does not affect cell growth. I remember that Szent-Gyorgi's proverb "Discovery consists of seeing what everybody has seen and thinking what nobody has thought",although In the present case its finding is so small. Cheers,<br>

                    <li>This recipe is borderline between defined and non-axenic!! Grow up E.coli (b/r) or Klebsiella to late log. ctf harvest the grown bacteria (you'd want about a 1&nbsp;ml&nbsp;pellet) into an isotonic buffered saline (try 0.1M Na/K PO<sub><small>4</small></sub>, pH6.3//100% bonner's saline). after 2 - 3 washes, this should be growth-medium free. Autoclave the bacterial suspension. Use aliquots of the dead bacteria into dicty suspended in the same buffered-saline in aerated suspension culture. separate amoebae from rest by ctf harvesting<br>
                        you'll have to play some games getting the bacterial aliquot just right for your growth conditions but it works- trick is not having the bacteria overwhelm the amoebae with growth inhibitors. so- you just grow up a lot of suspension to get enough amoebae.<br>
