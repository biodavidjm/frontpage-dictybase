I am following the methodology from <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=342">Berks and Kay, 1988</a>. In this paper cells were plated at 2.5x10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. I am using 150 mm dishes and am finding this density too low to yield high enough levels of RNA (for differential display). I was wondering if anyone could tell me whether the stalk cell induction of HM44 is density dependent as I want to increase to a density of 5x10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, would I also need to increase the levels of cAMP and DIF-1?

            <ul>
                <li>For appropriate advice, I need to know the precise aim of your experiment, but... as every one knows, HM44 produces a small amount of DIF so that the cells accumulate, for example, ecmA and ecmB in 2 days of in vitro culture (10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) with 5 mM cAMP (no DIF addition) (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3467">Kubohara and Okamoto 1994</a> Fig.7), and finally (2-day incubation with 5 mM cAMP) less than 1-2% of them differentiate into stalk cells. Simply thinking, if you increase cell density (up to 5x10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>) under our conditions, stalk formation without exogenous DIF-1 will reach 5-10% or less. Under our conditions (5 mM cAMP, no DIF addition), the accumulation of ecmA and ecmB in HM44 is so small within 1 day (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3462">Kubohara and Okamoto, 1993</a> Fig.1,2; <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3467">Kubohara and Okamoto 1994</a> Fig.7).<br>

                    </ul>2500 U/ml is roughly 25 nM of DIF-1?! I think 30-100 nM is OK. But the concentration of DIF-1 affects not only time mode of the accumulation of DIF-inducible genes but also the expression of prespore genes (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3462">Kubohara and Okamoto, 1993</a> Fig.1,2) which transiently appear in in vitro stalk formation (V12M2 and HM44). Anyway, 1-10 nM of DIF-1 and 5 mM cAMP are sufficient for the stalk cell induction (&gt;85%) in HM44 (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3462">Kubohara and Okamoto, 1993</a>, Table1).<br>

                <a name="celldiff3" id="celldiff3"></a> <b>Volume of stalk and spore cells in Dictyostelium discoideum: Dear all, I just read the paper of <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=1292">DeAngelo, Kish &amp; Kolmes, 1990</a> but I am left with a few questions that are difficult to solve for me as a social insect biologist, hence my posting on this list. The paper reports interesting data on the relative allocation to sterile stalk and reproductive spore cells as a function of whether one strain or two strains are grown together. Growing two strains together has the consequence of lowering relatedness from 1 to 1/2. As expected from kin selection arguments, the relative allocation to stalk cells decreases at lower relatedness. However in the table they only give stalk length and spore capsule diameter but not absolute cell count data. Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I could possibly recalculate their data into estimates of relative allocation to stalk and spore CELLS? Presumably, for this I would need realistic estimates of stalk and spore cell volume and a typical stalk diameter. Does any of you have such data for D. discoideum? Also, is any of you aware of similar data as that reported in this paper, and whether there are any genetic data on natural populations, i.e. whether slugs are typically composed of 1 clone or whether they are commonly composed of more than one clone? I'm asking this because I just made an evolutionary model that predicts the evolutionary stable allocation to stalk vs. spore cells as a function of relatedness. If one assumes that 1/3 allocation to stalk cells maximises dispersal, then the best allocation should be 83% investment in spore cells at r=0.5 rather than 2/3 (66%) for r=1. Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated.</b><br>

                    The question of altruism in Dicty has been considered for many years but the essential quantitative data have been sparse. Personally, I think that most fruiting bodies in the wild are clonal and so stalk cells are no more altruistic than my skin cells. They keep it together.<br>
