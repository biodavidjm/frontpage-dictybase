                <li>We've done RNAi for calcineurin and it was working pretty well. We make the RNAi constructs more or less how it is described in the manuscript of <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=4050">Martens, et. al. 2002</a>. Usually we make 2 PCR products of the target gene: one of 400 bp and one of 500 bp. Both we clone in a TA cloning vector and then subclone one of them in opposite direction so that later the mRNA can form a stem loop (100 bp for the loop seems to be sufficient). In the case of Calcineurin B we cloned these inverse construct in a pDNeoII vector which has an actin6 promotor. Well if Dicty is very sensible for silencing of the target protein it will not work, than you need the Tet off system described by <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=387">Blaauw et al. 2000</a>. For using this system you need two plasmids: MB35 and MB38. MB35 you have to transform into Dicty. Inside of MB38 you have to clone your RNAi construct and afterwards you transform your plasmid construct inside of Dicty-MB35.<br>
                    <br>
                    We transform our cells by electorporation and keep them the whole time in HL5 medium with antibiotics. Monoclonal sorting we make in micro titer plates by diluting the cells. It seems to be that a lot of people have problems establishing RNAi. Maybe its important to keep the cells the whole time axenicly with antibiotics. We tried the method described here for 3 genes now and it was working with all of them.<br>

            <ul>
                <li>A student of mine started to make a Dicty puro vector some years ago. She gave up for two reasons. One is that 100-200&nbsp;µg/ml of puromycin are needed to kill Ax2. Puromycin costs nearly ten times as much as G418, so this could become a major expense. The second problem is that the puromycin N-acetyl transferase gene from Streptomyces alboniger, which is used in mammalian-cell vectors, is 75% GC and thus very atypical for Dicty. I still have the gene and can send it to you or anyone else on request.<br>

                <li>The thy1 (thymidine selection) and pyr5-6 (uracil selection) genes work well as selectable markers in gene disruptions in auxotrophic strains lacking these genes. The selection for thy1 gene has the advantage of using HL-5 medium whereas selections for the pyr5-6 gene generally requires a defined minimal medium. The selection time (10-14 days) for both of these markers is a bit longer than blasticidin selection but they don't require the addition of any drugs. These genes also offer different internal restriction enzyme sites than the blasticidin or G418r genes which might be useful in construction and excision of your gene disruption vector.<br>

The expression of an ochre suppressor mutant of the GluII(UUA) tRNA appears to be lethal to Dictyostelium, and offers a novel 'positive negative' strategy to select for targeted gene disruption by homologous recombination. Inclusion of the suppressor tRNA gene decreases the overall transformation frequency by approximately 20-fold. This increases the proportion of targeted gene disruptions to over 90%.<br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>It is fast. Transformants form clones that develop, through fruiting, right on the selection plates. This means that if you are looking for changes in developmental morphology or reporter expression patterns in your transformants, you can have your answer in as little as 3 or 4 days after electroporation.

                        <li>The plates are virtually contamination-proof. The vector makes Dicty transformation easily feasible in undergraduate teaching labs. One should not even need a sterile hood.

                <li>Hi everyone, Here is our 2 cents worth - we routinely use Micrococcus luteus lawns The G418 concentrations required are only 15&nbsp;µg/ml - similar to selection in liquid medium, there is no preselection step so little opportunity for transformants to multiply prior to plating giving rise to siblings, and there is no "leakage" of wildtype cells ie. no false positives. The method was published in <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=6866">Plasmid 32, 182-194 (1994)</a>. In our hands it works well with any of the G418 resistance vectors we try - you don't need the V18 promoter and especially high level expression etc. The first transformants appear after about 6 days (but can take longer) so it is slower than other selections, but in our hands at least it is a very, very clean selection.<br>

                <li>For those interested, <a ng-href="/research/techniques/transformation/knecht_electroporation_protocol.html">here is our latest transformation protocol</a>. It seems very robust in our hands, and many people who have tried it have also found it works well for them. As to the selection on bacteria, despite my supposed infallibility (Yikes, Marcus!) Harry assures me that there is a difference between the Actin 6 and 15 cassettes such that he can select transformants on bacteria plates with A15TN903 but not with A6Tn5. That of course raises the question of whether there is a difference in the two neo genes in addition to/as opposed to the promoters themselves. In relation to Paul's comments, the repression of the actin promoters on bacteria only happened very early in veg growth when the bacterial lawns were thick. The expression turned on long before there was any visible sign of growth, ie. when the lawn was thinning, but still not obviously clearing. Therefore, I presume that on Luteus lawns, which are always thin, the repression is incomplete and that is why the selection works. Harry's selection is a normal bacterial growth plate and since he can get transformants, it is clear that enough A15Tn903 is expressed for cells to survive. I don't understand the difference in our data, but at least I don't have to worry about being infallible anymore.<br>

                <li>Just a note on the thickness of the M. luteus lawns. We use quite thick SM agar plates (maybe 35&nbsp;ml&nbsp;SM agar per plate) so we find that our M. luteus lawns grow quite thick usually ... so I don't think thin lawns are why the selection works. However we have done most of our work with the actin15 promoter so maybe the actin 6 could be a problem.<br>

                <li>First, the most distinguishing characteristic of NC4A2 is its motility. It is highly motile and thus does not form colonies on plastic in HL5 but spreads rapidly. If you need clonality, select in HL5 and then clone on SM plates or else select in 96 well microtiter plates. You can plate in normal dishes and plate at low density to only have 5-10 transformants per plate and then they tend to be separated enough to pick with a pippetman. As to transformation not working, this is not the first time I have heard it. If Bsr is working, that limits the options. How well is bsr working? You should be getting thousands of transformants per cuvette. If you are getting only a few, then it may be efficiency. Is you time constant in the right range? One thing we have found recently is new batches of G418 are more pure. As you go up in G418 concentration, in general you go down in efficiency. What I look for is cells being normal after 24 hours in drug, rounding at 48 hours and detaching by 72. If they are dead after one day, drop the G418. Also, the HL5 can cause cels to grow at high density, but not low density. Try plating about 50 cells in a 10ml dish and see if they grow out OK. If not, then your HL5 may be no good. This would be most likely peptone problems (what are you using) or water. I think I remember hearing that some people had trouble moving to new labs where the water was too good. I now make my HL5 with tap water because our other is so pure that we fear missing some trace elements. Remember, these guys grow in soil, so water quality is not normally too high. That should give you a start. Let me know what you find from these ideas and we can go from there.<br>

                    We had cells growing in monolayer culture in HL5 in 8 well slides, and just pipetted in oligos to the HL5 and gently shook the slide.

                    Apparently, this is not a total problem with all acetomethoxy esters; successful labelling can be done with the pH dependent dye BCECF, as well as the esterified chloromethylfluorescein.

                    Fura-2 was added at a final concentration of 90&nbsp;µM to a 100&nbsp;µl&nbsp;aliquot of a freshly starved cell suspension (1-3.10E7 cells/ml in 50 mM sucrose). Electroporation was carried out using a BioRad Gene Pulser with a single low voltage pulse (0.09 kV/mm, 25&nbsp;µF capacitance, 200 ohms, cuvette width 1 mm). Amoebae were revived in HMK buffer (20 mM HEPES-NaOH, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, pH6.9) at room temperature immediately after pulsing. Excess dye was removed by spinning cells down in buffer and cells were dispersed on non-nutrient agar plates. Fluorescence persisted until the slug stage and, in some cases, well beyond.<br>
                    It is important NOT to perform the post-electroporation incubation in cold buffer; that leads to dye sequestration, as can be seen from a pattern of punctate - as opposed to uniform - intracellular fluorescence.<br>

One possible reason: do not keep your wild type cells in suspension culture for too long! We have observed that after a few weeks retroelements get activated and may cause mutations (<a href="http://www.dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=11209">Kuhlmann, et al 2005</a>).

                <li>One possibility is that they are not genuine transformants. 10&nbsp;µg/ml is fine normally but is at the low end of the range and there is batch variation in G418 potency. If you had a less potent batch you could be seeing wild type cells or G418 resistant mutants that are unhappy but managing. We don't like going below 15&nbsp;µg/ml G418 in liquid medium for this reason. I should add that we normally select transformants clonally on Micrococcus lawns (<a href="http://www.dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=6866">Wilczynska and Fisher 1994</a>).<br>

                <li>I don't use coli but I can say that all the labile gal transformants I have made grow nicely on Klebsiella on plates. I have also grown many of these in Klebsiella suspensions, and never seen a problem. Another point -- any of you who are still using the "first generation" ubi-his-gal might want to know that there is a much-improved reporter out, in which the alpha-peptide, partially deleted in the original, has been restored. This gives a huge increase in activity, and allows one to go to a shorter-halflife gal and still get much better detectability than ubi-his. Applications have been described in: <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=8397">Gaudet et al 2001</a>, <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3886">MacWilliams et al 2001</a>, <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=5003">Rafols et al 2001</a>. The official name of the new reporter is i-alphagal. Anyone who wants it is welcome --- just contact me.<br>

                <a name="transfo11" id="transfo11"></a> <b>Unstable phenotype: I am attempting to perform control experiments between AX4 and GFP-labeled AX4 where I plate out a 50:50 mixture of the two clones. I then look at the ratio of the two clones both in cells and in spores. Because these are the same clone, the only difference between the two is that one is labeled, I expect to find an equal ratio of the two clones both in the cells and the spores. This will serve as a control to test for cheating (any time the ratio is not 50:50) in lines derived from the AX4 strain that have been through many generations of bottlenecking in order to generate mutations. When I do these experiments, the GFP-labeled strain always loses, meaning that unlabeled AX4 is overrepresented. What usually happens is that there is a 50:50 mix of the two clones in the cells, but this number drops in favor of the unlabeled AX4 in the spores. However, the degree of decline is not stable and changes every time I try to replicate this. I was wondering if anyone had experience with this sort of thing, and what advice you could offer me?</b><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Have you checked to see the penetrance of GFP expresssion in your GFP labelled AX4? In most cases, there is less than 100% penetrance - that is, cells will not be uniformly labelled in intensity. So, if you mix this 50:50, the labelled cells will always appear to lose because they aren't *all* visibly labelled.<br>
                    I would suggest instead using two different labels (say, GFP and YFP), and use them at ~ 5% each in a bulk mass of unlabelled cells, and checking for competition between the two labelled "tracer" lines as a rate of change from baseline.<br>
