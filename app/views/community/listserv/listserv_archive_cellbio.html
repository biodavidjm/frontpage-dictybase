            <li>As far as I know, no such inhibitors exist. The most specific block for exocytosis is provided by the temperature sensitive NSF mutant of <a href="/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=8245" thompson="" bretscher=""></a> but in this mutant, cell movement and morphogenesis are blocked at the restrictive temperature. My feeling is that this is inevitable: if exocytosis is blocked, then cell motility is also blocked.

            <li>We have used lysotracker red at low concentration and found that it labels GFP-vatB decorated vesicles, thus also lysosomes. However it labels also the contractile vacuole, whe should be neutral inside. Neutral red fails to label the contractile vacuole though labeling others GFP-vatB decorated vesicles. Our conclusion is that lysotracker red is possibly less specific than suggested by Molecular Probes, in any case less than neutral red.<br>

In one case, three AX3 cells immediately responded and contacted the pipette tip after 25 minutes and stayed there until the end of recording at 28 minutes.

            <li>Stefan, Ira Melman had a Journal of Cell Biology paper in 1994 with good assays for the measurements for phagocytosis by flow cytometry. The reference for quenching the fluorescence of bound particles is: Hed, Hallden, Johansson, Larsson P. The use of fluorescence quenching in flow cytofluorometry to measure the attachment and ingestion phases in phagocytosis in peripheral blood without prior cell separation. J Immunol Methods. 1987 Jul 16;101(1):119-25.<br>
                The trypan blue method works well for FITC-labeled bugs. However, my experience is that as long as the eating period is relatively long (greater than 30 min), then if one does 2 washes (by centrifugation) after the feeding period, the number of bound bugs is small in comparison to the eaten bugs, and can be ignored. This is easy to check by fluorescence microscopy. Best regards,<br>

            <li>Hi, We've had the same experience as Stefan. In all the tests that we could do (like binding beads or bacteria at 4°C) it seems that bound bacteria can not be detected by FACS. I would guess that bound bacteria detach in the FACS, and/or represent only very low numbers.<br>

            <li>Growth on a wide range of bacteria was tested by <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=1328">Depraitere and Darmon 1978</a>. Some Pseudomonas were found to be toxic and most of our problems with mixed cultures ahve alsobeed due to Pseudomonas like bacteria. We once had a big problem with a multiple antibiotic bacterium which was identified as Weeksella virosa (which seems to be the same as Flavobacterium genitale). This bug would keep going through multiple subcultures from spore heads. Back to Depraitere sudy, they also found some strains of Serratia marcescens and Bacillus thuringensis were not eaten. I have wondered whether legionella would persist in Dicty.<br>

            <li>In response to Pierre' and Martin's messages on phagocytosis: in our ongoing study of phagocytosis in Dicty, we are also looking for microbes which are toxic, starting with the data published by Depaitrere and Darmon, mentioned by Martin (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=9219">Annal Microbiol 129B, 451</a>). In that paper, there is no clear-cut discrimination between phagocytosis and growth (except for a few cases). In our hands, Serratia marcescens is taken up very well by Dicty, but highly pigmented strains are toxic, i.e. it is the ingested pigment that inhibits Dicty's growth. Similarly, the pigment hemozoin produced by Plasmodium falciparum, once ingested, impairs cell growth. In reply to Ronnie's question: bacteria can be also labeled with TMR or TRITC.<br>

            <a name="cellbio7" id="cellbio7"></a> <b>Can anybody please give me some advice on the synchronisation of Dictyostelium. Iíve been growing AX2g cells in HL5 to a density of about 0.5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml (the doubling time is 11 hours), and then incubating them at either 9.6°C for 16 hours (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=148">Araki, 1994</a>) or 11.5°C for 20 hours (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3914">Maeda, 1986</a>).

        <ul>
            <li>Since attention seems to be turning again to the Dicty cell cycle, this question could be of general interest. I have done cold synchronization many times using the Araki method (9 degrees, 16 hours), and find it highly reliable as long as one keeps the cell concentration low -- I would place the upper limit at 7x10E5. The synchronization, however, is never complete and may be hard to see with a hemocytometer. In cell number curves, there may or may not be an initial lag; there is nearly always a phase of 3-5 hours during which the cell number increases 2-3 times faster than in unsynchronized cultures; finally, there is usually a phase of slower proliferation before the cells relapse to growth at their normal rate. To see this clearly, one needs very smooth curves with lots of points; I recommend using a coulter counter, counting every 20 minutes and weighing the diluent rather than pipetting it. If one measures nuclear DNA synthesis (30-minute BrdU labelling, anti-BrdU staining) the results are basically consistent with the above but much easier to see. The fraction of cells showing nuclear labelling is always near zero in cultures which have just been warmed up, generally increases to around than 30% at 3-4 hours, and then declines to about 12%; sometimes there is a second peak 8-12 hours after the first. This degree of synchronization is quite sufficient to determine whether an easily quantitated, population-level parameter -- like reporter activity -- is cell-cycle correlated. For phenomena at the level of individual ameba the many unsynchronized cells are likely to be confusing; one will need a very clear hypothesis, a lot of data, and statistics. Greetings to all,<br>

            <li>I have experience using Leitz, Zeiss, and Narishige manipulators, and chosen Narishige because of integrity and available options. When I chose my system, it was probably a most dedicated 'manual' hydraulic system, and it still works just fine. My system was basically designed to "inject" into cells, and for externally applying cAMP for chemotaxis experiment, a simpler unit like the one Jeff suggested should work just fine. Narishige models are also much cheaper than other models I looked at, and US head quarter provides sufficient technical support. See also <a href="/techniques/geneex/agaroverlay.htm">http://dictybase.org/techniques/geneex/agaroverlay.htm</a> . Exact model numbers are printed in this paper. Good luck<br>
