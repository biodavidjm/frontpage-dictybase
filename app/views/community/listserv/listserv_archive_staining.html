Generally, staining with crystal violet or coomassie blue concurrent with or following fixation was suggested. The suggestions I received are summarized below. Following Ann Hitt and Richard Gomer's suggestions, we directly stained with coomassie blue stain for protein gels (~0.03% coomassie R-250, 3% acetic acid, 50% methanol) and got staining adequate for imaging.

            <li>Hoechst 33342 is exported out of Dicty cells, probably through an ABC-transporter mechanism (Irene Tatischeff has reported the presence of non-cellular, Hoechst staining bodies in cultures of Dicty). I observed a subpopulation of prestalk cells that retained Hoechst, but never did anything with that.<br>
                I have heard anecdotal stories of using DAPI as a live cell DNA stain; perhaps the newer DIPI, with its affinity for AT, may be a better stain. Has anyone tried Molecular Probes' SYTO-16 on dicty?<br>

            <li>I have tried a range of Syto dyes from the Molecular Probes sample set and generally none stained nuclei of live cells in my hands. I had it work once, and could not repeat it, so I suspect there is a trick that I haven't re-created. Someone reported one of them working at a past Dicty meeting, but I could not find specific information when I went back to check.<br>

            <li>I have also tried the Syto dyes and had little to no luck. I also found that the critters didn't seem to like it at all, so even if there was some semblance of staining, there was no crawling. Alas, you can't study motility on a cell that doesn't crawl.<br>

            <li>We have used DAPI to stain living cells. You have to use electroporation to drive it across the membrane but once in the cell it will stain the nucleus and mitochondria very nicely. The cells seem to be fine for at least a couple of hours but after that the mitochondria appear to swell and the cells start looking funky. Good Luck,<br>

            <li>I have done it with DAPI, so I am surprised that Hoechst 33258 does not work. The concentration is critical and should not be higher than about 0.1 µg/ml. Sometimes a fresh solution works well, sometimes an older one. We prepare the working solution fresh from a 100x stock (always in dist. water). The problem then is how do you visualize the stain? The dyes fluoresce under UV light, which kills the cells, unless you hit them with a very low dose and use video-enhancement. Good luck!<br>

            <li>I know well how difficult it is to stain nuclei into living Dictyostelium cells both with Hoechst 33342 and with DAPI ! The more alive the cells are and the more difficult is the task !!... If you really don't wish to fix the cells before staining, you can first work with Hoechst 33342 as a vital stain in (HL5) growth medium. Then, you can improve the nuclear staining by a "some hours" stay at 4∞C: the cells are still alive but probably somewhat less healthy (!), so nuclear staining is improved. However, it remains still unhomogeneous from cell to cell. You can also immediately wash the cells out of the growth medium containing Hoechst 33342 and, then, fix the cells with 70% MeOH in buffer. Following the fixation step, nuclei become fully accessible to the stain which accumulated inside the living cells, without probably being able to reach the nuclei. It gives a nice homogeneous staining of the nuclei, following the vital staining of the cells....but, of course, these cells are dead "for ever"! Therefore, it might be a way to measure the cellular capacity for internalizing Hoechst 33342, but if your goal is to further work with living cells, you have to find a better trick!!! Good luck and thanks for sending me the final result of your investigation.<br>

Only trick that I could notice is to wash cells before staining, because HL-5 contains bunch of fluolescent materials which make annoying background staining.

Also stained uneaten E.coli. Gives a vivid confocal image clearly separable from FITC. This dye is preferentially lipid soluble so you want leave a slight endogenous excess to keep loading the cell- there is no background fluorescence! original use was preferential staining of mitochondria with very low short-time doses of h-r. Loading of organelle and up to whole cell ("background") staining is dose and time dependent.<br>
