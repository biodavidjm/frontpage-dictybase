Actually it is a mixture of two mouse monoclonal antibodies, not three. This Roche anti-GFP works perfectly in western blot, very clean background with dicty lysate. In immunoprecipitation, I can capture the free GFP in cell lysate. I'm still working on my protocol to see whether it's able to pull down my GFP fusion protein. The initial trials failed. Generally, I'll recommend to give this anti-GFP a try.<br>

            <li>As pointed out by Herb Ennis, nogalomycin is a useful inhibitor of RNA synthesis. Upjohn made a series of Nogalomycins (U12,241, U15,167 and U20,661) which we found to block spore germination. Other useful inhibitors reported to be RNA synthesis inhibitors which blocked spore germination included Daunomycin, Thiolutin and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide.

Unfortunately, all the inhibitors that I thought to use (cycloheximide, puromycin, anisomycin, etc) are known to affect endocytosis and phagocytosis even at low dose. Does someone know another protein synthesis inhibitor that I can use which has less effect on endocytosis and phagocytosis? Maybe all the protein synthesis inhibitors have inhibitory effect on endocytosis and phagocytosis. If you have an idea, let me know... Thank you</b><br>

            <li>We used cycloheximide to block protein synthesis, leaving secretion intact, and it worked nicely (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=4272">Monnat et al., 2000</a>). The conditions are as follows: "Cells expressing the GFP constructs were treated for up to 4 h with 1.6 mM cycloheximide, a dose sufficient to block protein synthesis by 98% (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=4335">Müller-Taubenberger et al, 1988</a>)". Now you say that it blocks endocytosis, is this a reference to work published (I think I remember a report in a Dicty book by the Sartre/Grenoble people on something like that) or your own experience? <i>[Note from Steve: Yes, it was the case. The paper is: <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=2256">Gonzalez C and Satre M 1991</a>. Surprisingly this paper is not accessible trough PubMed or on the web site of JCS. I do not know why. I found the paper because it was referenced by another paper... and finally found the hard copy of the paper in the archive of library of my university!]</i> If different inhibitors of protein synthesis with completely different modes of action block endocytosis, the simplest explanation is that a short lived protein is essential. I am interested in the response you will get to your question and to the results of such experiments. Best wishes,<br>

            <li>Years ago, we investigated several inhibitors of protein synthesis. In addition to cycloheximide and anisomycin, emetine was very effective, and also pactamycin. Emetine inhibition was readily reversible, without irreversible developmental effects; pactamycin, less so. Puromycin did NOT work for us on developing cells. I have not concerned myself with these drugs for a long while, and can't tell you now of other processes they may also target.

            <li>We tried a number a few years ago on pathways that we knew were regulated by proteosomal degradation and saw not effect, including no build up of ubiquitinated products. I do not remember what we used but we also tried "industrial" strength levels. Since we tried a few, I am assuming that they either didn't get inn or, more probably, they got secreted rapidly by tyhe ABC transporters. Best-<br>
