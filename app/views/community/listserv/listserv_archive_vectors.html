After a cleavable signal peptide, they have BglII and BamHI sites upstream of and downstream from a c-myc tag.

            <li>Dear Mohammed- I can comment on the last one. We have done extensive work on the inducible tRNA system. It is quite a challenge to use, although we have a paper ready for submission inwhich we used it. It has been extremely difficult to get reproducible and robust inducibility. For reasons we do not understand, the cells rapidly lose the repression in the absence of tet leading to loss of induction (ie it becomes more constitutive over time.). There are ideas we have as to how to improve it, but I don't have the hands at the moment to do it. Therefore, if you need something that works now, I would recommend the discoidin system, since that works well in ours and others hands.<br>

            <li>Hi everyone, On November 18 Mohammed Benghezal requested for a good system for inducible protein expression in Dicty. As many of you may know, we presented during the Dicty meeting in Maine our results on a tetracyclin-inducible protein expression system (see abstract below). In our hands the system is excellent allowing a more than 2000-fold induction of protein expression. During the meeting we informed the field that the inducible system is availlable for the community upon completion of the experiments. Since the Dicty meeting we have performed additional experiments concerning the kinetics of induction and induction in individual cells. Presently we are writing a manuscript describing the system, which we expect to submit at the end of the year [see <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=387">Blaauw, Linskens, and van Haastert, 2000</a>] In January 2000 we will be ready to distribute the two plasmids and additional information concerning the use of the system to everyone that has asked for them (or will). For your information we will put in the coming weeks the maps of the plasmids on our web site. With best regards,<br>

        <ul>
            <li>I suspect the question should be: what vectors do not become unstable during cloning in E. coli when you add such large amounts of A+T DNA. You are proposing Dicty plasmid DNA (600bp for Ddp2 ori, 7.2kb for Ddp1) promoter &amp; polyadenylation for selective marker (perhaps 600bp) and then your promoter and gene. I would suggest the best course would be to adapt the Ddp2 based expression vectors (eg pMUW2442) which are small 3.1 kb and do not need to contain a selective marker. The selective marker is carried on a separate integrating plasmid (eg pMUW110) which supplies the Ddp2 ORF in trans. Thus it would be neccessary to swop the selective marker in pMUW110 or just insert the Ddp2 Rep gene into the vector of your choice. We have versions of the extrachromosomal plasmid pMUW2442 which lack any promoter or polyadenylation sequences, just having the Ddp2 ori and a BamHI site where the expression cassette was inserted. From memory, the size of the basic construct is about 2.5 kb. There is nothing smaller. The Ddp1 based, 13 kb p155dI shuttle vector (Dennis Welker's lab) is getting a bit big for adding a A+T rich gene.<br>

            <li>pREP is a plasmid that contains the origin of replication from the Dictyostelium plasmid DdP2 and the "ORF" (origin recognition factor or something like that) which binds to the ORI and is necessary to keep the plasmid extrachromosomal (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=3624">Leiting, Lindner and Noegel, 1990</a>). You can use it as a helper plasmid for vectors carrying the ORI but no ORF. the system did not work optimally, however, since there seems to be competition between the two plasmids. There are now strains available (e.g. from Piero Morandini; Milano) which have the ORF integrated into the genome.<br>

Many of the common restriction enzyme sites have been mapped in this fragment. I don't know if anyone has done a direct comparison between thy1 and Bsr selectable markers in gene disruptions but I suspect there is some recombination of thy1 marker with the mutant thy1 locus in JH10 cells. Note the thy1 is defective in this strain due to the insertion of the pyr5-6 gene into thy1 locus. We have been able to obtain ~40% efficiency in gene disruptions with some genes using the thy1 gene and JH10 cells. Best regards,<br>
