            <a name="biochem8" id="biochem8"></a> <b>How to break cells without detergent? Recently I am doing protein purification in Dicty. I need to lyse cells without detergent in ~30ml volume of lysis buffer. Filtrate through 5.0 uM Whatman filter is good for small volume, but the filter is easy to break or be blocked in my case. Does anyone else know other methods to break Dicty efficiently? Thanks in advance,<br></b><br>

        <ul>
            <li>One possible solution to your problem is hypotonic lysis. Take a look at <a href="/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=2608">Hereld et al 1994</a> under "Preparation of Membranes" and references therein. In this method from the Devreotes lab, cells are equilibrated in high salt, pelleted, and resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing protease inhibitors, causing them to burst. The focus in their application was the membranes, but it might also be a good starting point for cytosolic components.<br>
                Other traditional methods I'm aware of are dounce homogenization (breaks cells by shearing) and nitrogen cavitation (basically the cellular equivalent of the bends). However, I don't know how well these methods work for Dicty. Maybe someone out there in Dicty-space knows or has a better suggestion. Good luck!<br>

            <li>When doing large volumes, prefilter the cell suspension prepared in buffered 0.25&nbsp;M sucrose (no Mg or EDTA) through a bed of loosely packed glass wool mounted on a vacuum erlenmeyer. Then you should be able to push &gt;100&nbsp;ml through a 47-mm diameter 5-micron nuclepore filter before needing to change it, unless the cells have been sitting in stationary phase for a long time.

            <li>In our hands homogenizing cells with Dounce did not work. Dictyo cells are very resistant to shearing forces (maybe due in part to their small size). Cell homogenizers (cell crackers) work very well. Have a look at <a target="new" href="www.isobiotec.com">www.isobiotec.com</a>. If you resuspend your cell pellet in an equivalent volume of medium then pass it 20 times through a cell cracker you break the cells very efficiently. Best<br>

            <li>I had this problem in about 1980, and used a Parr Bomb. You equilibrate the cells at about 250&nbsp;psi for about 15 minutes at 4¡C, and then they break when you let them out dropwise. You need stirring during the incubation in order to get the solution to equilibrate uniformly. We used to grow about 25&nbsp;liters of Dictyostelium generating 250 packed ml of cells and a 500&nbsp;ml of lysis solution. I have used smaller volumes such as your 30&nbsp;ml. Find a graduated cylinder that fits into the bomb so that the column of solution is high enough that you don't waste too much. Make sure the stir bar at the bottom is going around after the lid is in place on the bomb with the collection stem in your vessel of cells. We published the method as part of another purification in <a href="/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=1677">Fechheimer &amp; Furukawa 1991</a>. The Parr bomb is not cheap, but if you look around at NIH, I am sure that there are lots of them there. Good luck.<br>

            <li>We observe apparently complete lysis from freeze-thaw without detergent. I am writing from memory so details may be off. I think you can find references for this in Spudich papers if not elsewhere. Drip a 10^8cell/ml suspension with protease inhibitors into liquid nitrogen. (Leave out DTT if the next step would expose antibodies to this reducing agent.) The result is frozen spheres ("popcorn") of ~100&nbsp;µg that store very well at -80¡. Thaw them in an equal volume of buffer with protease inhibitors.<br>

            <li>Parr bombs are absolutely wonderful and much the best answer if you're doing a big prep. They're absolutely streets better than any other method I've seen when volumes get large. They also actually make little (10&nbsp;ml) ones which I've never tried.<br>

            <li>Our collective experience in the laboratories of Michael Brenner, Ted Steck and in my lab can be summarized as follows: First you must know the location of the protein that you are purifying: cytosolic, lumen of the membrane compartment, transmembrane in organelles or PM. Some of the methods will make a difference, particularly because Dicty has notorious proteolytic activities. 1. Passing through 2 layers of 5 micron Nuclpore filters works best. Has minimum release of endo-lysosomal content including hydrolases.<br>
                2. Freeze-thaw will work but will lyse most of the endo-lyso and therefore stability of the protein in question will be compromised.<br>
                3. Mild sonication works but again release of proteases is the issue but it is not as bad as Freeze-thaw but certainly not as good as passing thro' filters.<br>
                4. Hypotonic lysis will work but again release of hydrolase/proteases are problem.<br>
                5. Dounce does not work.<br>
                Basically if I were you, I will be able to decide depending upon the nature of the protein to be purified and its intracellular location.<br>

            <li>Can't help too much with inhibitors (although the mixture that Klein &amp; Devreotes used to purify cAR1 seems to work very well, at cost of great complexity). But I do suggest:<br>
                (a) filter lysis, if appropriate (ie target is not membrane bound)- doesn't rupture the organelles as badly as detergent<br>
                (b) use starved cells if possible - they have lower protease levels<br>
                (c) lower the cell density - both proteolysis and protein aggregation increase at higher densities, and the inhibitors work better at a higher ratio of inhibitors:proteases<br>
                (d) if you can include EDTA it blocks metalloproteases. It can of course wreck some proteins too.<br>

            <li>The best method depends on what you are going after. Do you want the soluble fraction, cytoskeleton, an organelle, or its membrane or its luminal contents? The filter lysis method, which as others have noted is superior for keeping organelles intact, is fast, efficient, and works well down to 2 x 10exp8 cells and up to tens of liters. If you have too many samples and/or can deal with the release of DNA and acid hydrolases, sonication can have its place. As an update to our 1992 paper(<a href="/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=2259">Gonzalez-Yanes et al. 1992</a>), we have successfully purified many soluble and vesicle proteins from filter-lysed growing and developing cells using 1 microM PMSF (with special precautions), 10 microG/ml aprotinin and 10 microG/ml leupeptin, keeping it cold and working fast. We have not needed other inhibitors, though we do use EDTA (as mentioned by Insall) too if conditions allow it.<br>

I used anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies to pull down XFP-proteins. Triton X-100 (0.1-0.5 %) is also good.

Indeed, with the one repeat, the cells come up bacteria-free (if you're growing dicty with bacteria as food. if not- this is a moot point). Centrifuge cell suspension @ 50 x gravity for 3-4 min, using 15&nbsp;ml&nbsp;plastic conical centrifuge tubes. This gives a firm yet soft sediment from which the supernatant should be aspirated as quickly as possible. The sediment should be resuspended in standard saline, or whatever you wish, also as quickly as possible to a volume &gt;10&nbsp;ml&nbsp; (these amoebae do not "like" being anoxic for too long.) We routinely get ~0.2&nbsp;ml&nbsp;of pellet from ~12ml of suspension of a 24 hr culture. Repeat centrifugation and harvesting, the final volume can be whatever you need depending upon cell density, etc. this routinely gives viable physiologically reponsive cells with &gt;99.9% of the original suspension fluid removed. overall time = &lt;10 min. if you want sterile, just use sterile saline and sterile capped tubes and do transfers under sterile conditions.<br>

            <li>After posing a question about speed vs. viability in Dictyostelium pelleting, I decided to check it out for myself. The answer posted by Dr. Jared L. Rifkin (thanks Jared) took too long for the assay we are running. If anyone is interested, the results are as follows: A centrifugation at 3000 X g for 1 minute was sufficient to return virtually 100% of the cells from the pellet with 100% of the original viability, as assessed by duplicate cell counting using Trypan blue. Less force failed to return the full cell count. A pulse of 15,000 X g for 10 seconds had the same result. After reflection, I should have realized that a totally fluid structure within a fluid medium would be hgihly g-tolerant, but sometimes I just have to see for myself. This was one of those technical details that I couldn't believe I hadn't learned somewhere, and really couldn't find a consensus on once I looked.<br>

However, it appears that the combination of the Y13-259 antibody and 0¡C is insufficient to prevent GTP hydrolysis, so the IP-based assay didn't work well, and that RasG didn't bind the Raf-RBD even when activated, making the GST-Raf based assay fail.

            <li>There apears to be some debate in the literature regarding in vitro PKA assays in Dicty. In mammalian cells the regulatory subunit of PKA is tightly bound to the catalytic subunit in the absence of cAMP, so that assays of PKA in lysates give an accurate reflection of PKA activity (and relative intracellular cAMP level) in vivo. Historically, the literature for Dicty has indicated that these assays do not work. The regulatory and catalytic subunits quickly dissociate when lysates are made. PKA is fully activated, even in the absence of cAMP. On the other hand, other Dicty workers have recently reported data using these assays, but I have never seen the old biochemical dissociation assertions refuted. I can attest to the success in mammalian cells, but never tried them in Dicty so I have no personal experience. I am interested in other opinions, experiences...<br>

            <li>Dicty cells will take up 35S methionine if this is not diluted with axenic medium and is presented to them on filters without much dilution. The method and incorporation data can be found in <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=4440">Newell, Longlands &amp; Sussman 1971</a>. Best wishes,<br>

            <li>We have always had good success with 35S-met. What helps most is to plate the cells on Nuclepore filters which are really thin (get much more isotope incorporated that on, say, Millipores). Then transfer the filter from its support (usually agar) to sit right on top of a droplet of label in an otherwise empty petri dish (cell side up because the liquid in the drop goes through the filter instantly but cells are not submerged if the droplet is small). See <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=1198">Das and Henderson 1983</a> and <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=1199">Das and Henderson 1983</a> for more details. Note that we always label in buffer without nutrients but in a short pulse quite a lot of label gets in.<br>
