This paper is a classic and was influential in putting Dictyostelium on the molecular biology map. The method involves triturating the aggregates through a pipet and I have done it many times. A few years later I (<a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=76">Alexander, Brackenbury and Sussman</a>) published a paper in Nature (1975) that used trypsin to disaggregate cells. And Dave <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=5081">Ratner</a> had a paper in Exp. Cell Res. (1983) where they use proteases to make cells that they then separated into prespore and prestalk populations. The latter two methods alter the cell surface of course.<br>

There appear to be many small vesicles that fluoresce at blue, green and red wavelengths (I am using a 360nm excitation and a 420nm emission filter if that helps). Has anyone encountered the same problem? Does anyone know of any conditions to grow cells under to remove this background?

            <ul>
                <li>Everyone who does live cell imaging encounters this problem, since HL5 is fluorescent. What we typically do is starve the cells in buffer for 1-2 hours if our signal is low. Obviously if the signal is strong enough, you don't worry about a little background. This helps, but does not totally eliminate the problem. You must also be wary however that the cells are starved and that might affect the biology.<br>

                <li>The following holds true for nc-4h cells - I don't have any specific data about the transition dynamics for any of the AX# cells: washing bacterial-grown dicty doesn't generate truly "starved" amoebae (ie- loss of folate sensitivity and gain of camp sensitivity) for perhaps 10 hrs after washing. there appears to be a very slow turn on (starting ~3-4 hrs after wash) of camp sensitivity and a very slow and long (&gt;14 hrs) shut-down of folate reponsiveness. (all this goes back ~30 years to reports by Bonner&amp; Pan&amp; Sachsenheimer, et al. and <a href="http://dictybase.org/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=475">Bonner et al 1970</a>)<br>
                    <br>
                    Like I said- this is true for NC-4h. Perhaps it is time for someone do to some old-fashioned time-course chemotaxis assays on ax# strains ("starved" for n hrs, etc.). I'll do it later this spring if ax# spores are sent to me (along with recipe and protocols for growing these axenic strains. (that's right- I work with NC-4h. Why "assume" that a half century of behavioral and life-cycle data for nc-4h is the same for the ax# strains??!)<br>

                <li>The HL5 fluorescence problem keeps coming up. At least for the S65T-gfp wavelength range, there is a simple, workable solution: low-fluorescence axenic medium (see recipe below). This also works fine at excitation 360/emission 510. I have not tried excitation 360/emission 420, but here I suspect there is significant cytosolic fluorescence that will be difficult to get rid of in any way.<br>

                <li>I made up the LoFlo and LoFlo w/ yeast extract according to the protocol by Harry MacWilliams (Dicty listserv Jan 10, '02) and I have found that it works great. The only variation is that my yeast extract is provided by Difco and not Oxoid. I suppose that this does not make a difference in the autofluorescence, although the experiment has not been done.<br>
                    <br>
                    I am in Day #3 of doing growth curves and the AX-4 cells in HL-5 and LoFlo + yeast extract look identical and their growth is very similar. The cells in LoFlo+yeast extract have just been titered at 2e6/ml and growth may taper off. Cells in LoFlo have a slightly altered morphology (bigger vesicles and more cells elongated) and their growth is lagging behind a bit (reduced by 10-20%).<br>
                    <br>
                    Looking in the fluorescence microscope, I cannot distinguish by eye any difference in autofluorescence between cells grown in LoFlo and LoFlo+yeast extract. The vesicle autofluorescence of cells grown in HL-5 is much higher than the cells grown in both LoFlo media. Autofluorescence was greatly reduced in the filters used to see fluoresceine (490/520-530), rhodamine, and the S65T-gfp.<br>

                <li>I have come up with an axenic medium with vastly reduced fluorescence which is based on casein peptone. Cells may not grow in it indefinitely, but they will increase in number at least an order of magnitude before showing signs of starvation.<br>

                <li>Indeed, autofluorescence results from vesicles filled with axenic medium. Therefore, washing cells does not help a lot. one way to get around the problem is to grow cells on bacteria. a different way that I can also recommend, is to use the wt-GFP instead of the red-shifted S65T mutation. if you illuminate cells expressing wt-GFP with UV light (eg the DAPI filter set) the autofluorescence appears blue, while the GFP fluorescence glows in green.<br>

                <li>A good way to get rid of the growth media caused fluorescence is to switch over to this caesin peptone from Merck, instead of the regular Oxoid peptone. The only problem besides the cost and easy availability that I faced was that the cells do not grow to as high densities as in the normal media. But, this nonetheless gives you significant reduction in the background. Let me know if you want any more details.<br>

                <li>I had trouble with the autofluorescence of Dicty when I was measuring intracellular pH. I didn't think of the media causing the autofluorescence though. One way to test that idea is to titrate the media to different pH values and measure the fluorescence between a slide and cover slip. I used little wells on microscope slides to measure pH calibration curves. I suppose you could use cloning rings on a slide if you have inverted optics.<br>

                <li>The background fluorescence of internalized nutrient compounds can be highly reduced using a confocal microscope. You also can get rid of the background when you observe the cells in non-nutrient medium (phosphate buffer) or if you do not want to starve the cells while adding bacteria as nutrient source (E.coli B/r) to the phosphate buffer.<br>

                <li>Can't help much at all, except to confirm that axenically grown Dicty do have considerable autofluorescence which diminishes several-fold in the early hours of development. If your protocol can tolerate a pre-period of buffer suspension, that has some effect. When we have used strong promoters for GFP, autofluorescence is entirely negligible (1%) but it can certainly muck up the situation for a weak promoter. Because the autofluorescence looks yellower than GFP signal, we have tried a few filters in microscopy, but failed to find any magic solution. For flow cytometry, one can do a cross-channel correction (Fl 1 -x%Fl 2) which can make some numbers look better, but I get nervous as the data get manipulated more. Are you using a mutated GFP? The S65T change helps markedly. Lastly, when we raise the conc. of G418 of transformants, the desired GFP signal does increase, and not, as far as we have seen, due to any major change in copy number. Something else is going on. None of this may be new to you, but it's all I know.<br>

The fluorescent substance(s) observed only inter spore matrix in a spore mass. The main components of the fluorescence are thought to be Dictyo-pterine in vegitative stage and Dictyo-lumazine in developmental stage. I could wash out the fluorescence by cold-methanol fixation and water. If you want to observe a fluorescence in a living cell, my suggestion may not be effective.<br>

                    Meanwhile we found that fixation with methanol works fine if you fix for 20 sec to 2 min (try) at -20°C. GFP fluorescence is well conserved and the cells can be stained for nucleic acids with 5 °g/ml propidium iodide.

It's very sensitive and can be used both on dissecting and fluorescent microscopes and good resolution (approx. 1100x1400) but it's B&amp;W (mostly for fluorescent stuff which we are going to be doing on a dissecting scope looking at cell movement).<br>

                <li>I have heard good things about the Pixera Pro for color light microscopy. It is probably not sensitive enough for weak fluoescence, but I have not tried it so don't know. It is not a cooled integrating camera, but is digital and about $1000. Many people have used the Cohu with integrating capability and an Scion frame grabbing board and NIH Image to accomplish the same thing for about $2000 total (gray scale or filter wheel for color). This is sensitive for many fluorescence applications unless you are talking really weak and needing really high resolution. The $20,000 digital cameras (Princeton, Photometrics) will do it all if you have the $$$.<br>
