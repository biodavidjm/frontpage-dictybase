   Dear colleagues,<br>
It is with profound sadness that we inform the Dictyostelium community of the passing of our dear friend and colleague Harry MacWilliams. Harry had been unwell the past few months. He was showing signs of recovery and decided to return to work. Harry collapsed in his office on Monday August 29, 2011 and did not regain consciousness. At this time, we do not have additional information concerning his sudden departure.<br><br>

Harry will be greatly missed.

This is very sad, he was an outstanding scientist and a kind teacher to many of us.

Yes, exactly.<br>

He was quiet but tough.

This is sad news indeed. Harry was such a kind, generous and sharing person and an amazingly creative scientist!! I know we will all feel his absence profoundly.

I've known Harry for about 30 years, and it was always a great pleasure to talk science with him.  I think he came into Dicty to try and solve the problem of 'morphogenetic fields' - as did many of us at that time - and his understanding of the  theory (reaction-diiffusion processes for instance) and clear thinking was unrivalled.  Later, he produced the invaluable unstable gal vectors for which he provided the most comprehensive imaginable plasmid maps.
He had an interesting basso profondo singing voice when the mood took him.
I shall miss him - all sympathy to his family.<br><br>

Harry was a rare person; always open to discussion, courteous and with very little ego. I think we all felt him to be a friend. I join with everyone in bidding him farewell.

I too am shocked and saddened by the news about Harry. He was a very talented, very generous and very respected friend and colleague who I will greatly miss seeing at the Dicty meetings.

I share in the deep sadness of the entire community. Harry was always stimulating, both as a  scientist and as a friend.  His work was invariably elegant and original. At a personal level I  will always treasure the memory of those happy times when he shared his American folk songs with us. 
<br><br>
I will miss him greatly

This comes as a shock. Harry and I got to know each other when we were
post-docs. He used to work with Hydra then and was designing experiments
to test the Gierer-Meinhardt model for spatial patterning. He was always
helpful in giving advice and passing on strains and plasmids. His skill in
plasmid design and much else led to a joint paper. The last news from him,
a couple of months ago, was that he was unwell yet again. But I never
imagined it could be this serious.

Having just returned from a weeks sailing up the BC coast (w/o 
email), my euphoria was rapidly brought back to earth by the sad news 
of Harry's death.  I too have known Harry for over 30 years and 
benefited enormously from many stimulating discussions, particularly 
on the role of the cell cycle in cell type determination.  He will be 
greatly missed by all of us, and even more so by his close 
collaborators.  My condolences to them and to his family.

                        Thank you so much for doing this. Harry set such a wonderful standard for
                        generousity and civility in our field and it is such a nice way for
                        keeping his memory alive and sharing his spirit and influence with the
                        younger Dicty people who did not have the chance to enjoy the many
                        memorable interactions that so many of us had with him over the years.

                        <blockquote>The thing I remember most clearly about Harry was the depth of his commitment, to Dicty and to science in general.  He really obsessed about the best possible tools and the most complete understanding, which is why he generated so many important techniques and tools, and annonated so many genes.
                        This was also reflected in how much he cared about his talks - I remember him going to bed early (and unable to sleep) for fretting about the details of his talk the following day - plenty of postdocs were much less attentive.<br>

                        <i>David Ratner</i>
                        <blockquote>Others have written movingly of Harry’s clever insights, dogged pursuit of fascinating developmental problems (purely theoretical, or in terms of Dicty or Hydra), skills as an experimentalist, and generosity to our entire Dicty community.  Naturally I agree whole-heartedly with those observations, but hope I can be allowed a more personal and admittedly idiosyncratic recollection.  Almost a decade ago Harry called me to ask if he might stop by my office in Amherst, with—and I had not anticipated this—his father accompanying.  It seems that Walter MacWilliams, an accomplished, retired Bell Labs engineer now living an hour from the college, had learned from a distance the wonderful ways in which Harry had inspired and guided young students of biology, and wondered if he himself might in some way aid that same cause.  In the end, the three of us devised a scheme by which Walter would monetarily support a couple of Amherst College undergraduates during a ten week research internship, thus augmenting the number of students whose research we at the College could otherwise sustain.  Walter has generously continued to meet with and financially support summer undergraduate researchers each year since, and I’ve gotten to know him a bit as a result.  From those visits with Walter, it’s easy to see the source, via Nature and Nurture, of Harry’s breadth of intellectual curiosity.  But the reason I tell of this arrangement is a comment Harry made to me some years in: it turns out that, quite long ago and before I myself had come to Amherst, Harry had applied for a job in the Biology Department here, which job he wasn’t offered.  I was struck then and am still by the wonderful generosity of spirit shown both by Harry and his father: Harry bore no grudge, that’s for sure.  We shall all miss him, for very many reasons.<br>
