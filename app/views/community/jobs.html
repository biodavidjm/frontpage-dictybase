				          There is a three year postdoctoral position available to investigate macropinocytosis. <br><br>

				Macropinocytosis is a neglected and poorly understood cell biological process which has recently started attracting more attention and will, I believe, develop into an exciting field.  Macropinocytosis is used by immune cells to gather antigens, can be used for feeding by tumour cells, and may be the route by which prions and tau deposits spread from cell to cell in the brain.  Macropinocytosis is also the route by which Dictyostelium cells feed on liquid media.<br><br>

				Macropinosomes are organised around PIP3 patches in the plasma membrane, which have been extensively studied in Dicty, and we have recently identified a RasGAP that controls patch formation and whose mutation allows axenic growth.  This, combined with the ease with which classical genetic selections can be applied to the problem, make Dicty an extremely attractive model in which to study macropinocytosis.<br><br>

				The project will primarily be with Dictyostelium cells, with collaborative possibilities on dendritic cells.<br><br>

				A 3 year postdoctoral position is available in the Dacks Lab at the University of Alberta, examining the evolution of the contractile vacuole. The contractile vacuole (CV) is an osmoregulatory organelle found in ecologically important and diverse freshwater and soil-dwelling organisms (eg. ciliates, dictyostelids). Nonetheless, CV cell biology is only now being assessed using modern methods. As the name implies, the CV is presumed to be a vacuole/lysosome homologue. This project will use molecular evolutionary and transcriptomic analysis to examine the evolution and function of the CV, specifically whether it is derived from a single homologous ancestor or derived independently from endolysosomal organelles.<br><br>

				The preferred candidate must have a doctorate degree (and be within 5 years of this degree) at the time of taking up the position, should have a background in microbial eukaryotic cell biology or evolution and have published in these areas. Technical expertise in cell biology of microbial eukaryotes, ideally Dictyostelium or a ciliate would be a significant asset. Salary will be competitive with UAlberta standards and includes benefits (~$37 000).<br><br>

				            <b></b>Identifying novel molecular mechanisms for cannabinoids in epilepsy control using a simple non-animal model system<br><br>
				             
				            <b>Project description:</b><br><br>

							Epilepsy is a common and severe neurological condition affecting up to 1% of the population worldwide. Despite the development of a range of new anti-epileptic drugs around 30% of diagnosed patients continue to experience seizures. Therefore the development of new treatments for epilepsy provides a solution to a major unmet need. Recently a range of components of cannabis that lack psychoactive effects have demonstrated promising anti-epileptic activity. Surprisingly, the molecular mechanism of these components remains unclear. We have employed the simple biomedical model system, Dictyostelium, to identify unknown molecular mechanisms of a range of compounds used in epilepsy control and for other therapeutic treatments and natural products. In this PhD, we will extend the use of Dictyostelium to identify the molecular mechanism of cannabinoids in relation to epilepsy control.<br><br>

							The successful applicant will use Dictyostelium and other models to identify and characterize molecular mechanisms of cannabinoids involving a range of molecular cell biology techniques. The project forms part of a wider preclinical investigation and so the successful applicant will form part of, and be supported by, a wider research team based at other academic sites, and by ongoing clinical studies. Thus, the project will involve an integrated approach for the analysis of cannabinoid function in health in multiple systems. All equipment, expertise and facilities necessary for the conduct of the project have been fully funded or are already in place. Appropriate training will be given as necessary.<br><br>
							
							<b>This will be an extremely competitive program and applications are requested from outstanding Masters graduates or undergraduate students in their final year of a degree, with background knowledge in the areas of biochemistry, molecular biology, or cell biology.</b><br><br>

							The project will provide a stipend of £12 593 p/a. Please note that successful applicants must have appropriate UK/EU residence eligibility. Funding is provided by our industrial partner, GW pharmaceuticals.<br><br>

				             <b>Project description:</b><br><br>
				             
				             A healthy diet includes a range of natural plant-derived flavonoids. These, often highly coloured plant pigments, have a range of health associated effects, including as anti-oxidants, anti-inflammation, anti-viral, and anti-cancer agents. Understanding the role of these flavonoids in human health has been hampered by a lack of insight into their molecular mechanism(s), reducing the potential for enhancing human health by dietary intake. We have used the simple non-animal model Dictyostelium to investigate the molecular mechanism of several tastants including the flavonoid naringenin (Waheed et al 2013; Robery et al 2013), to identify a health related target for flavonoids, the calcium channel polycystin 2. This project will continue an integrated approach for the analysis of flavonoid function in health.<br><br>
				             
				             The project will specifically employ molecular cell biology techniques to knockout the polycystin genes in Dictyostelium, and a range of flavonoids will be tested on Dictyostelium cells to determine which flavonoids function through this mechanism. These Dictyostelium cells will also be used to express human polycystin proteins, to assess flavonoid function and specificity in relation to human health. The project with be jointly supervised by Prof David T Dexter, Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London), to provide transition of resulting data to mammalian systems, and to identify health related effects for flavonoids. Thus, the project will provide an integrated approach for the analysis of flavonoid function in health in multiple systems.<br><br>

				        The cell biochemistry group at the University of Groningen is offering a PhD position for 4 years.<br><br>
				        
				        Mutations in human leucine-rich-repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) have been found to be thus far the most frequent cause of late-onset Parkinson’s disease. Our main aim is to understand how human LRRK2 is activated, and how Parkinson’s disease associated mutations in the protein result in its hyper-activation. LRRK2 belongs to the Roco family of proteins, which are characterized by the presence of a Ras-like G-domain, called Roc and a kinase domain. Since all attempts to purify mammalian LRRK2 have failed so far, we focus on Dictyostelium Roco proteins which have very similar domain structure and characteristics as LRRK2, but are biochemically more tractable and therefore can serve as an excellent model for LRRK2 (Gilsbach et al., 2012). This project is part of a NWO-VIDI grant and the Michael J. Fox LRRK2 structure and function consortium.<br><br>

It is envisaged this work will use a combination of Dictyostelium genetics and quantitative/computational analysis, though we are interested in general mechanisms, so findings will be confirmed in cultured mammalian cells and in vivo models. The work will focus on mechanisms that generate and promote the growth of new actin pseudopods (see Andrew & Insall, NCB 9, 193 & Ura et al., Curr Bio 22:553). Techniques will involve some of: high-level microscopy on multiple platforms including TIRF, FRET/FLIM and FRAP, Dictyostelium growth & genetics, mammalian cell culture, analysis of microscopic data using ImageJ and MatLab, and computational modelling of the results.<br><br>
				        
				        A relevant PhD is essential. Experience in microscopy, Java and/or MatLab programming, cell biology, molecular biology and genetics, and a good record of quality publications would be an advantage. You will have good knowledge of the literature, enthusiasm and flexibility to work on a wide range of techniques as needed.<br><br>

				<p>
				Presenilin function in Alzheimer's disease:  Developing a new non-animal model for analysing the cellular role of human proteins<br><br>    
				        
				Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating condition leading to dementia and ultimate death over an extended period of time. The disease is becoming more common in our society, possibly due to the aging nature of our population and this highlights the critical need to better understand (and thus treat) the disease. A large proportion of current research into Alzheimer's disease focuses on mutation in one of two presenilin genes, in familial cases, causing early onset. Research in this area is challenging, since deletion of both alleles of the two mammalian presenilin genes causes embryo lethality. Investigating the fundamental role of presenilin proteins has provided the central approach to understanding inherited forms of Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of the cellular role of these proteins has been complex, due to two forms of the protein (Psen1 and 2) in mammalian systems, and a block in development (and eventual lethality) caused by the simultaneous deletion of both forms [1]. Despite this, animals remain the key source of cells in this research.<br><br>
				   
				To reduce animal-based experimentation in presenilin research, we have investigated a conserved role for these proteins in the simple biomedical model, Dictyostelium discoideum [2]. We have previously used this model in a variety of biomedical projects including epilepsy [3,4], bipolar disorder [5-7] and toxicological studies [8,9]. This social amoeba is the most primitive species to possess two presenilin proteins, and the proteins have a key role in development [10]. Our recent studies have shown functionality for the Human presenilin 1 (Hpsen1) protein in rescuing this developmental defect, proving the suitability of using Dictyostelium in an animal-reduction research approach to understanding mammalian presenilin signalling.<br><br>
				   
				Although our current discoveries have establish Dictyostelium as an excellent new approach to reduce and replace animal experimentation in understanding Human presenilin 1(Hpsen1)-dependent signalling, no study has yet addressed the role of the Human presenilin 2 (Hpsen2) protein in this system nor compared cellular function between the two Human proteins.  This two year postdoctoral position will continue to develop Dictyostelium as an alternative model for presenilin research, focusing on comparing the role of Hpsen1 and 2 in this model. The project is highly likely to lead to high impact publications, and a significant impact on world knowledge relating to the role of presenilin proteins in cell function, and will provide an exciting new model system for presenilin (and Alzheimer's disease research) without the loss of animal life.<br><br>
				 
				Applicants are expected to have a strong background in molecular cell biology, microscopy and biochemistry. As a senior member of an active research group, the applicant will help in supervision of PhD, Masters, and project students, and take a significant role in managing a laboratory.<br><br>
				  
				Applications close shortly (31/8) and we hope to have the applicant in place as soon as possible, thus please contact Robin Williams by <a href="mailto:robin.williams@rhul.ac.uk">e-mail</a> as soon as possible with a curriculum vitae and cover letter explaining your interest in the project and your range of skills that will make you suitable for this position.<br><br>
