            dictyBase curators, in collaboration with Jeff Williams from the University of Dundee, have developed an ontology to describe Dictyostelium, the <b>Dictyostelium anatomy ontology</b>, where we define the structural makeup of Dictyostelium and its composing parts including the different cell types, throughout its life cycle.<br>
            <br>
            There are two main goals for this new tool: (1) promote the consistent annotation of Dictyostelium-specific events, such as phenotypes (already in use), and in the future, of gene epxression information; and (2) encourage researchers to use the same terms with the same intended meaning. To this end, all terms are defined. The paper we have published (<a target="new" href="/db/cgi-bin/dictyBase/reference/reference.pl?refNo=11778">Gaudet, Williams, Fey and Chisholm, 2008</a>) (<a target="new" href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/130">full text from BioMed Central</a>) gives a description of the ontology and definitions of the terms, in the context of the life cycle of Dictyostelium.

        <h2>
            Main terms of the Dictyostelium anatomy ontology
        </h2>
        <p>
            The following list of terms and definitions are the most general terms of the Dicty anatomy ontology. This list contains 37 out of the 137 terms in the complete ontology (version from May 29, 2008). We have also included links to phenotype terms that use the corresponding anatomy terms.

            Note that the ontology is dynamic and modifications will be made as knowledge evolves. If you would like to suggest modifications to the ontology or the terms and their definitions, please email dictybase or use the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=76834&amp;atid=974664">Source Forge Dicty Anatomy Tracker</a>.
